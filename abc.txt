HTML Summary
Our page's content, structure, and meaning are all defined using HTML (HyperText
Markup Language).
You don't use it for styling purposes. Instead, use CSS for that!
HTML uses "elements" to describe (annotate) content
Typically, HTML elements have an opening tag, content, and a closing tag.
You can also have void (empty) elements like images
You can also configure elements with attributes
There's a long list of available elements but you'll gain experience over time, no
worries.
Learn more about all available HTML elements on the MDN HTML element reference.



CSS Summary

Understanding terms like "inheritance," "specificity," and "the box model" is
essential while dealing with CSS.
